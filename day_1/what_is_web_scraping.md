## What is Web Scraping?

The internet has endless information! If we want to use the information for anything other than reading it ourselves, we need to get it into a spreadsheet or database of some sort. Scraping allows us to get information that we see on any given website, and format it the way we want. 

Web Scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.

## How Does It Work?

We will go into a LOT more detail, but essentially:

## Who Uses Web Scraping?

Web Scraping is used by a lot of companies, and is necessary for a lot of things:
- Search Engines - (google search)
- Price comparison sites
- Market Research/Social Media
- Detect fraudulent reviews

It can also be used maliciously…
- Large Scale Content Scraping
- Take information and pretend you are the author

## Web Scraping 

- This is why websites use those CAPTCHAs - they want to make sure it’s a human, not a bot.
- This weekend, we get to the bots! 
- Don’t worry, we will make sure that we don’t use our power to do anything bad :) 

## Turn and Talk: 

- What websites do you use that you think might use web scraping?
- What makes you think that?
