# Personal Web Scraper

## Brainstorm and Prep 
- Choose an idea for your personal scraper! 
- Find a website to scrape.
- Write list of directions you need to give your bot once it goes to the site
- Get clear on what you want to display - images, data? How much? Current set up looks like Hedgehogs - 4 images or 4 rows. You can add to this! 
- Write down your plan, and get approval from instructor.

## Set Up
- Use [this](https://github.com/ameseee/personal-scraper-fe) as a starter kit for your front end. You'll see a lot of similarities to the hedgehog project, but some additional notes are written in to help you make it your own!
- Use [this]() as a starter kit for your back end and web scraper. You'll see some similarities in the way the hedgehog project is set up.

## Scraper
- Build out endpoint with web scraper 
- Go into front end and modify as needed. HTML and CSS files have some notes to help you out. 
- In the JavaScript file, you will need to update the endpoint location based on how you wrote the endpoint in your personal-scraper repo.
