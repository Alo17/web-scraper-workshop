# Personal Web Scraper

## Brainstorm and Prep 
- Choose an idea for your personal scraper! 
- Find a website to scrape.
- Write list of directions you need to give your bot once it goes to the site
- Get clear on what you want to display - images, data? How much? Current set up looks like Hedgehogs - 4 images or 4 rows. You can add to this! 
- Write down your plan, and get approval from instructor.

## Set Up
- Use [this](https://github.com/ameseee/personal-scraper-fe) as a starter kit for your front end. You'll see a lot of similarities to the hedgehog project, but some additional notes are written in to help you make it your own!

## Scraper
- Build out endpoint with web scraper 

## Front End 
- In the `index.html` file, you can change anything you need to. If you are following a similar format with four images, you just need to change out the starting images (lines 28-31).
- In the `styles.css` file, you can change the color scheme. You can also use this file to change the layout (if you'd rather have rows for your info than a 2x2 square of images). There is a note about how to do that.
- In the `index.js` file, you will need to update the endpoint location based on how you wrote the endpoint in your personal-scraper repo - line 19. You might also want to change out the text on the button (line 22).
